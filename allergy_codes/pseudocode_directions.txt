Given a number, find the combination of allergens


Thinking about using an array of score and then a
hash to tell you what the allergen is for each score.
Could iterate over the array then use the numbers found
to access the allergens from the hash.

Use some form of reduce where you iterate through each
check 1 + 2
check 1 + 4 etc
when you find a combo that matches return numbers combined
